### Hi there, I'm Slava  ðŸ‘‹
<!--
**(and this page looks best if viewed in the dark mode ðŸ˜‰)**

My name is Viacheslav Inderiakin (Slava for short), and I'm a second-year MS student at University of California, Los Angeles. My interest lies in ML applications in IoT and Autonomous Driving, so I am well-versed in writing embedded C code and training ML models using Tensorflow. If you want to reach me out about anything, just ping me ðŸ˜„
